INTRODUCTION

1.The FT5x06 Series ICs are single-chip capacitive touch panel controller ICs with a built-in 8 bit Micro-controller unit (MCU).   

2.They adopt the mutual capacitance approach, which supports true multi-touch capability. In conjunction with a mutual capacitive touch panel, the FT5x06 have user-friendly input functions, which can be applied on many portable devices, such as cellular phones, MIDs,netbook and notebook personal computers.

3.The FT5x06 series ICs include FT5206/FT5306/FT5406, the difference of their specifications will be listed individually in this datasheet.
